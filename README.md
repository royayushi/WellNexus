**With WellNexus, you will always be reminded to drink water and be health conscious.**

## 	:memo: Problem Statement:
**"The greatest wealth is health." - Virgil**<br/><br/>
But, sometimes, in the hustle and bustle of daily lives, we forget to take care of our health and wellness. Even incorporating the basic things in our routine can make our lives much more healthier. Every living being on Earth needs water for survival. In fact, our body is 70% water, however, a lot of times, we forget to drink the required amount of water, which can lead to dehydration and fatigue.<br/>
Children, oftentimes, find healthy things boring, and prefer junk food and unhealthy lifestyle over it. This is leading to many health conditions nowadays, like, obesity, diabetes etc. So, we decided to make a chrome extension that will remind users to drink water, and when clicked on the link on the extension, will open a website that will allow children to learn about health in a more fun way.

## :bulb: Inspiration
Our parents always tell us to drink more water, but we get caught up in other things, and forget to do so. This was the inspiration behind making the water reminder chrome extension, but while making it, another inspiration came and we decided to make an alarm to monitor our screen-time, and also to build a memory game and a quiz to take periodic breaks and pass the time in a fun but healthy way.

## :seedling: Proposed Solution:
Most of the time, we are sitting behind a laptop, so we thought why not make a chrome extension that will remind people to drink water? We also thought of creating a website that has a memory game with fruit images on it so that when children or adults alike play the game, they are reminded of the importance of including fibres in their diet. We also included a quiz game and an alarm clock. In the quiz game, there are common health related general knowledge questions, and with the use of alarm clock, users will be able to monitor their screen time, so that they do not forget to take a break every now and then!

## Chalenges We Faced:
We built a Chrome Extension for the first time, so it was definitely a challenge to learn and implement it in the project within two days. We have various functions in the extension like the alarm function, the stop alarm function, restoring and saving toggle function; and it was a challenge to try to figure out how to sync all those functions across various tabs.



## What's next for WellNexus?

We have plans to include a walking and a sleep reminder next in WellNexus.
